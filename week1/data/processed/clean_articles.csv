LSE delivers corporate actions data over Swift The London Stock Exchange (LSE) has begun distributing its UK corporate actions data in ISO15022 format over the Swift network. 0 16 August 2004 Be the first to comment Editorial This content has been selected, created and edited by the Finextra editorial team based upon its relevance and interest to our community. Users of the service will receive corporate actions in the ISO15022 format in near real-time throughout the operational day. LSE says the new product eliminates the need to re-key data into internal systems and reduces processing time delays. Furthermore, the service will help to meet the industry's demands for a move towards corporate actions standardisation and straight-through processing (STP). David Lester, chief information officer, LSE, comments: ""Automation of corporate actions handling is rapidly being recognised as an important and valuable back-office function – it saves money, helps eliminate the risk of human error and aids better deployment of staff."" The corporate actions data is compiled by LSE's team of analysts who scrutinise all regulatory news, correct and clarify errors and conduct further research.  Notification messages are then sent through to customers on an intra-day basis. Swift says it hopes the LSE service will lead the way for other exchanges to follow suit.

https://medium.com/@parsaahm/i-failed-ae8be3087ada,"I failed…. Intro to failing. | by Parsa Ahmadnezhad | Medium Sitemap Open in app Sign up Sign in Medium Logo Write Sign up Sign in I failed… Here’s why you should too Parsa Ahmadnezhad 4 min read · Jun 5, 2024 -- Listen Share “ Failure is so important. We speak about success all the time. It is the ability to resist failure or use failure that often leads to greater success. I’ve met people who don’t want to try for fear of failing.” — J.K. Rowling Press enter or click to view image in full size Photo by Mahdi Bafande on Unsplash I recently competed in a moonshot pitch competition, and I failed… I applied to lead my school’s prefect team, and I failed… I ran for my school’s Student Council, and I failed… But do you know what my problem is with this list? You might be thinking: “Well, Parsa you are an absolute failure.” Well yes, but no! It’s the fact that this list could’ve been longer… but it’s not. I explained in another article about overcoming procreation. And originally, I thought: “I overcame procrastination, now I can be successful!” But I was wrong. We all have dreams, goals, and things we want to achieve. For some of us it can be finishing a book, or maybe hitting a score on a game, to wanting to go to Harvard or becoming the next Elon Musk. So why is it so hard to be successful? Press enter or click to view image in full size Photo by LinkedIn Sales Solutions on Unsplash I was talking the other day with a friend of mine about success (crazy right?). And he brought up a good point about why most people don’t succeed. He asked me, “What is the best life you could have in 2 years?” And I laughed, jokingly: “I dunno, like maybe running my own business doing photography or someth’n?” He responded, “Have you started it…? And if not, why not?” I started listing a bunch of ‘ what ifs ’: “What if all the work I put in goes to waste and it doesn’t go anywhere? What if I can’t find enough clients?” And so many other things that would go wrong. And he responded to each single one, “Well, yeah of course if you just email 4 or 5 random people a day and just let the business be, it will fail. You can bring up your standards, work on it as best as you can for a month, email 100 people a day, use your resources, …” And he went on with tips to help me. But the important lesson wasn’t learning how to manage a business, it’s about that fear that was stopping me from simply , starting. This fear of failing is the killer of our success and stopping us from getting out of our comfort zone. The reason is that many people, including myself previously, view failure as absolute event. “Oh, I failed at this, I’m not good enough.” And that creates this fear of starting. Based on a research, they studied a bunch of successful people like Jeff Bezos, and based on their finding, the thing that separates all these individuals is the fact that they keep working even when things get really challenging. Most of us out here are waiting for that one day where everything is set, and everything is available for us, and it’s just that time when nothing can go wrong. Well, yeah that ain’t happening. This is just the fear that keeps telling us: “You will fail!” Then fail then! All the success even comes from failure. When was the last time you learned something from your success? Let me guess, it was all joy and happiness, likely nothing learned. This failure even be the key to reaching success at next step. But you’ll never know if you don’t try! Plus, failure might sometimes be even more beneficial than success. For example, if you are learning how to drive, and you keep crashing into objects while practicing; you fail, you learn the lesson and work on it. But if this never happens on practice, and it happens during driving in the streets, it might cost you your life… Another analogy, how do you think you can walk today? By not trying to walk because you were scared you would fall? So at the end of the day, it’s upon you to view failure in any way you like. But this fear of failing can have lots of disadvantages. It’s always better to say I wanted 1000 things, I tried all and failed, than to say, I wanted 1000 things, but I didn’t try… Don’t let this pain be always stuck with you, because you were scared to try. We must all suffer from one of two pains: the pain of discipline or the pain of regret. The difference is discipline weighs ounces while regret weighs tons. — Jim Rohn Press enter or click to view image in full size Red Pill (Day One) vs Blue Pill (One Day) The choice is yours.
