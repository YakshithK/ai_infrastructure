# üõ†Ô∏è AI Infra Portfolio ‚Äì Yakshith

## About Me

Hi! I‚Äôm **Yakshith, 16**, building **full-stack AI infrastructure** from dataset pipelines ‚Üí distributed training ‚Üí optimized serving ‚Üí multi-step agents. This repository tracks my **100-day AI Infra Sprint**, where I learn, build, and publish **production-ready AI systems**.

| 6    | Serving at Scale            | Containerized API (FastAPI + Docker + Kubernetes)                |
| 7    | Cost & Latency Optimization | Batching & caching layer, Grafana dashboard                      |
| 8    | Observability               | Prometheus + Grafana monitoring stack, alerts for drift & errors |
| 9    | Vector DBs                  | Retrieval-augmented LLM demo                                     |
| 10   | Agent Orchestration         | Multi-step agent (search ‚Üí execute ‚Üí summarize) demo             |
| 11   | Continuous Learning         | RLHF-ish loop for self-correction                                |
| 12   | Security & Robustness       | Hardened agent, guardrails, audit logs                           |
| 13   | Capstone                    | Integrated demo (<5 min), README, pitch deck                     |
| 14   | Positioning                 | Lab applications, public post, live demo                         |
